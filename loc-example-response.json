Of the latter the\nSecretary of the Treattiry issued\n20 millions during the panic, and\nquite an vtfjrt was made, first to\nreturn to the 356 millions atid next\nto adhere to the present volume of\n3S2 millions. It has been argued\nby Nev England and the Eastern\nStates that to increase the curren\ncy volume would leave no more in\ncirculation, but the West and South\nfailed to see the force of the jirgu\nmenr, and they carried the day. It\nseems evident that an increase\nwould make money m re abindant\nand tend to weaken values The\ndebtor would find it easier to pay\nand creditor easier to collect.

When the war began he eiitertd\ntlie army ai.d in oiii of the hotly eon\ntested battles lost a leg, for which, up\non returning home he sulwtituled a\ncork limb. His last union was blest\nwith several ch Mien, and all went\nalong smoothly until the year IstitJ,\nwhen he and his wife began discussing\nthe virtues of their former spouses,\nwhich produced a serious quarrel,\nending by the wife driving him lrom\nhome. Like Kip Van Winkle, he\nk'ssed his children and departed with\nout uue word of complaint or reproof.\nFrom his own threshold, he wandered\nover almost every portion of ihe world,\nand for eignt years his family nei'er\nreceived either letter or message from\nhim. On Saturday, when he took the\nears at Saimla, he was within a few\nmiles of his old home, from which he,\ntoo, had never heard a word since t he\nday he left. Ou the train he met an\nolJ acquaintance, who informed him\nthat his wife, supposing lfe had died,\nhad married ai a in and had two chil\ndren by her hfcft union ; 'hat she was\nliving tu the same old farm, aud, ai\nEnot k Arden was tnhl of An'iie, \"was\nhappy,\" Tbe old man replied that be\nwas not grieved at that, but that he\nreturned to see his children, of whom\nhe epoke very a-ti'ectionately The\nthird station the train stopped at, a\nyoung lady entered, who upon per\nceiving the old gentleman, examined\nhim very closely, after which bin.\nasked his name. He told her, and\nexclaiming. 4 Then you are my fai her, '\nfche threw herself iuto the old man's\narms. Both shed ters of joy at tbe re\nunion, and our informant dcribes\nthe scene as very atheiing. Tbe old\ngentleman has aeeumula ed qurt a\nneat sum of money in his wrtnrreritrgs.\nwhich he says he intends hiniseif and\nchildren to' ei.joy, and that he will\nleave his Wife inid her new husband\nto themselves on iheoM farm adding\nthat h\" will he I aiq-y in Company\nWilli his ila tig hrer,- who Is married,\nand that be fee in no destie to intt-rfeie\nwith t'-e happiness of his wife. Du\nbuque Herald\nThe V udcrwood-McVoiAli Case.\nMr McVeigh yesterday received\nfrom his lawyer in Washington a tele\ngram informing him that the Sup\nreme Court o the Uuileil Mates hail\ndismissed the writ of error granted\nsome time auo to Judge John (J.

Now it seems to ns\nthAt til this matter, which has car\nried orer to tho pergonal and det\nperate enemies of the A. M. & O\nK. it., the Sfnator and two dele!\ngates -from Scott and Lee ehould\nbe boiled down to a very portable\nqnantltr.\nThere is bat ono point upon\nwhich tan hinge the question of cen\noro or approval of the course and\nexfentiun of Gen. Mahone and his\ndirector.\nDoes the hesitation, or delay,\nor refusal ct Kentucky as to meet\ning them at the Gap justiSy, non\nncttju on their part. Now it is\nplain lo ns that outside of this issue\nall of us should be agreed, and\nit is folly for those of us who are\nfavorable to the C. Gap extension\nto do one tingle act which would\ntend to impair the power or ability\nof the company to go forward to\nward the Gap when ever a forward\nmovement may be practicable. It\nhas been alleged by parties who\nhold themselves responsible that\ntl is minority report is intended to\ncripple tho company, and, if it be\nsi. then we contend the movement\nU one which the Legislature shonld\nstamp out. These very parties\nuvcr most solemnly that Kentucky\nwill meet tts, and in jnat that event\nGen. ilahone and his Company\nneed no coercion. If Kentucky I e\nwilling let her say so in an author\nalive shape and not through prox\ni is who have no credentials as\nsuch. Are these gontlemcn blind\nto the fact they are now fighting\nGen. Mahono in obedience to a\nconcocted and clandestine scheme\nf certain parties who have sworn\nthat they intend to defeat forever\nthe very enterprise they so much\nwish. This minority report is in\ntended to weaken the friends of the\nCumberland Gap road and to\nBtrengthen its enemies, and under\nthese circumstances' we are 6orry it\nhu an endorser friend in the South\nwest.\nTHE LEGISLATURE.\nThe Senate and House have\nagreed to extend the session for a\nperiod not exceeding thirty days.\nThe tax bill 2 as been hewn and cut\nat every turn. Cel. Fulkerson suc\nceeded in engrafting upon it a pro\nvision that the school tax should he\npaid in money alone. The tax of\n$3 1-2 on marriage licences was de\nfeated. It is believed that after\nthe final carving and pruning which\nthe tax bill will get, it will be de\nfeated, and that between tho im\npulse of eslf-prcservatioa and the\nhard knot of the Funding Bill the\nState finances will be left in aumd\ndie. Wc can hardly think so.\nThe Cambcrl-nd Gap railroad\nextention is still before the House.\nMr. Richmond holds with the grip\nof a turtle, and his grip would seem\nto be about as void of tactics as\nmarks the tortoise, which will eeize\nthe object of his attack and hold\nuntil it is carried to some point\nwhich sa :ures its own rnin, and\nmeroly to a limited extent tor\nmenting its intended victim.\nThe minority report of Van\nAnken was tackled on Thursday,\nupon a motion to publish it, a warm\ndebate followed and tho cooler\nminds oi tho House stamped it with\nthe effect of inflicting on the A. M.\nA O. K. R. Co., an injury which ist\nsuccessful answer cocld not soon\ncounteract and they very wisely re\nfused t print it. Mr. Richmond\nthen asked leave to print it at his\nown expense, and was at ones pro\n. aonnced onicf order. Mr. Fclker\noa Ueiled the incendiary, Van\nAnken, and was so pointed in his\nremake as to be callel to order.\nOa Friday Mr. Hagmder moved\nthe appointment ;of a committee of\neveo, with power to setad for per\nm PPr8 lo FQnie\nMszebisg investigation ixfto\n-v: fsaid report. M?.-\ntereon-Jhaaked him lor ttt\nj2i'(ion, '\nai it would give the company its\ndesired opportunity for refuting the\ncharges.\nThe Dauville R. It. Company\nhas applied for leave to conaslidate\n.with the Piedmont road, tnd the\nSenate has agreed, provided the\nDanville rond will relinquish its\nexemption from taxation.\nGov. Kemper has sent in an able\nmctsage upon the finances of the\nState. He asks a conce6tion on\nthe pnrt of thoBe holding the obli\ngations of the State, so that four per\ncent, interest may be paid now and\nthe,remainder when the State be-\nv i . -h j .\ncomes able, lie shows that m lSbU\nthe agregate taxable values, within\nthe present limits of Virginia Tere\n$632,000,000, and in 1873 they\nwere only $336,000,000.\nTHE NEW MOVEMENT.\nTho American people seem bent\nupon crusades against urbelief,\nugauist whisky, against anti-farm-ing\ninterest and ngainst republican\nism. There can be no doubt that\nthe spirit of prayer and the spirit\nof resistance are row running hand\nin hand. Nor need it be so pass\ning strange, that a people should\nboth pray for the good and resist\nihc evil. We have the authority of\nheaven tor the divine injunction\nthat those who preach must be\nsoldiers of the Cross. Never in all\nAmerica has the revival interest\nclimbed so high and descended so\nlow upon the great social scale\nwhich measures man's iniquity.\nIn all portions of the union the\nchurch is reaping a rich harvest of\nbelievers, who are fresh from the\nfield of vhe. Why it should be\nthat a people should have seasons\nof repentance or paroxysms of be\nlief, we do not attempt to say. We\nspeak of the fact that it ia now so,\nand the good work is not done yet.\nThe war npen whiskey has\nreached wonderful proportions and\nhas assumed the strangest phases.\nWoman, who is without political\nsuffrage, has armed herself with\nsocial power, and clad in tho ten\nder mail, which is the chief protect\ntion of her sex, has gone forth into\nthe highway and hedges, compel\ning evil doers to close their ave\nnues to ruin. We do not write\ndown our approval of thi3 unpre\ncedented means of throtling the\nmightiest giant of social evil, which\nhas maimed mankind and disfigured\nthe world, but if woman can pre\nvent the physical destruction of\nman, clothe him in his right mind\nand place him in the way where\nJesus is to pass to-day, we shall\nraise no voluntary arm toarrcat the\nwork.\nThe farmers have a right to the\nmeans ior developing their ener\ngies for the subjugation of the\nthorns and thistles in their wa\nand we are willing that their work\nshall make more impossible and\nunintelligible the present arbitrary\npolitical divisions of our people.\nThis means the destruction of the\ngreat political organization which\nhad its conception in the womb of\nour artillery, and liko all things\nhuman, mut eventually go down\nnnder the farmer's heel.\nWe believe its day of doom and\ndeath has come, and 1874 will se\ntie the question. There are newnr\nand better roads ahead of ns. Let\nns get up and pursue them to the\nbetter country beyond.\nFor tee New.\nMr. Editor: \"Fair play is a Jew-\ncl,\" and we thought as mutn, after\ncareful reading of the communication\nof \"Justice, 1 it yours of the 24th Inst.,\nand his strictures upon what ho is\npleaded to term, \"the Kane Richmond\nmovement,\" in the Interest of the\nCumberland Gap extension. The late\naction of the delegate from Scotland\nLee, \"Justice\" thinks, will resuyjm\nirreparable damage to the people of\nthose Counties and of Bristol. From\nour standpoint, we could see \"Justice\"\nin no other light, than that of an infer\natcd party, whose effort, was designed\nto throw the friends of the C. O. It, It.\noff of the \"true scent.\" And the bet\nter to accomplish this purpose, he\nwould make the impression abroad\nthrough the Bute, that the action of\nthe delegates from Scott and Lee, had\nbeen brought In the interest of a sin\ngle prominent gentleman, of the coun\nty of Scott, by calling it the \"Kane\nRichmond movement.\" Justice\" at\ntho same time avering, that the peo\nple of the State bad no feeling, but of\nindignation, towards \"Messrs. Gibson\nRichmond kc.,\" ho alone are to be\nrecognized (by inference) as the real\nauthors of the \"minority reports,\"\npresented by \"Van Aukeu.\" Justice\nat the same time roundly berates the\n\"Van Auken minority leport\" as \"a\ndastardly, and cowardly effort to de\nstroy the credit of the A. M. & O. R.\nR Co.\" We have nothing tu ay for,\nor against Mr. Van Auken, or his\n\"minority report,\" \"Justice\" evident\nly wouI1 have the public believe, that\n'his head ia level' upon this point, in\nparticular, and it is clear to our\nmind, that he means to associate the\nDelegates from Scott, and Lee, and\nnot only with Van Aukeu, and his\n\"cowardly effort to bring the Company\nand it officers into disrepute,\" but he\nreally makea thcrn the attaches of\n\"Lyons, Tom Scott, & C\" wbom\n\"Justice\" is pleased to recognize, as a\nnotorious lobbyist,\" whose record and\nbase efforts and purposes will be veu\ntilated in due time. The people of\nScott-, Lee, and Bristol, (we take it)\nkuowbut little of those disreputable\nparties, the minority report is yet the\nproperty of the House of Delegates,\nand has not been made public, as far\nas we are Informed, Mews. Gibson,\nRichmond, aud : Prldemore, are the\nchohen Representatives of the. people\nof Sott and Lee, and we, (if we can\n.be allowed fo express an opinion at all\nii the nrmtiHfs feel secure in the dec\nration, tl. at thc?c gentlemen stand\nJ as high to-day in the estimation of\ntneir constituents, ana tne people or\nthe South West, as any delegation\nholding a seat in the present House of\nRepresentatives. Their only crime\nrests, in their most laudable efforts, to\ncarry through, the bill securing the\ncompletion of a road, . vital to our peo\nple, and their section In particular,\nand in our judgment, cf equal impor\ntance, to the future commercial pros\nperity of Virginia, Roads, and Va.'\nCities, along the entire consolidated\nline'. We art not surprised to find\nthose gentlemen clinging to this bill,\nas the last hope almost of their gectlon;\nclutching it with the deadly grasp of\nthe shipwrecked marriner, \"clinging\nto the last plank when the night and\ntempest close around him.\" Verily!\nthey are worthy of high commenda\ntion, for every honest effort looking to\ntne completion of this work. Justice'\ncertainly does not mean to bring the\ncharge, that any reputable gentleman\nfrom thia section, in, or out of the\nHouse of Delegates, would be a party\nto the \"blackmailing\" process, alluded\nlo in his article of the 24th inet. Nor\nwill we believe that he designed a re\nflection (even indirectly) upon the\nconstituents of those gentlemen, or\nthat he designed to make the impress\noa. that those Delegates, were parties\nto a 'corrupt alliance.\" We tuke 'Jus\ntice 1 to be a gentleman too well versed\nin the use and application of words,\nnot to understand, that when an ex\npression is casta', the character oa\nUepreseutative, acting iu accord with\n111(1 auown wishes of his constituents.\nthey, and not the Representative alone\nare equally obnoxious to any charge of\ntreacuery or crime. And it is well\nkuowu to you, Mr. Editor, as is pat\neut to every voter in the 6. West, that\nthe action of the Delegate from Scott,\nf.ud Lee and their associates, is in full\nccord with the sentiment of nine-\ntenths c: the voting population of\nthose counties. 'oris it true (as fre\nbelieve) that the citizens cf Lee, Scott,\nand Washington, even entertain a de\nsire in the remotest degree, damaging\nto the credit of the A. M. & O. R. R.\nCo. If a crime has been committed\nat all, does it not then become the\nact of the people of Scott. Lee. and\nBristol, rather than of their Represen\ntative, w no renect their withes, and\nwho have not been censured yet by the\npeople. If our premises are correct,\nthe whole weight and force of \"Jus\ntice's\" severe censure, should right\nfully fall upon the people of the sec\ntion, represented by the \"Kane Rich\nmond movement,\" as he is pleased to\nterm it. In casting about for the stat\nus of the people of Bristol, we recog\nnize them as occupying the same\nboat along with the people of Scott\nand Lee. And upon this vital subject,\nBristol may r e regarded as holding an\ninterest in common with any section,\nfeeling the dep importance of an early\ncompletion of the Va. & Ky., R. R.\nBeing then one iu interest, one in sen\ntiment, aud a unit so far as the prompt\ncompletion of this great work from\nBristol to Cumberland Gap is con\ncerned, we hold ourselves guiltless to\nany charge, of a desire, or desigu in\nthe remotest, of doing damage to the\nconsolidated line. It is true, our peo\nple were smarting under the apparent\nneglect, aud apathy of the powers that\nle. who held as it were, this great\nwork, in the hollow of their hands.\nAnd we are mistaken in the men, if\nMessrs Pridemore, Richmond, and\nGibson, (who are the only parties in\nthe Legislature, who could possibly be\nof thu Kane Richmond movement) if\nthey do not show to their people, and\nours, that they have not beeu misrep\nresenting their section wearing the\n\"collar\" of no \"lobbyist\" or \"Railroad\nRing,\" iu or out of Richmond. We\nare at a lots to see how the action of\nthe S. Western Delegates, could preju\ndice the credit of the A. M & O. R. R.\nCo., without undoing some act. inside\nof the written law, incomoratiug the\nsaid Company, nor are we able to un\nderstand, how the action could in any\nwise tend, lo destroy, or depreciate,\nthe bonds of the Co , unless they had\nsought to make use of them, for a pur\npeso foreign to the design of the origi\nnal character. We are not aware that\nany effort has yet been made, to force\nthe management of te Va consolida\nted line, outaide of the written law, au\nthorizing the construction of the Va.\nKy. R. R. But we can see how a peo\nple might be aroused upon a subject\nwhich they regarded as vital to their\nbest interest, which the limit fixed by\nlaw, fixing the time for its completion,\nwas rapidly drawing to an end, with\nscarcely a ray of hops that any future\nLegislature would even exteiid it.\nNor do they find much comfort even\nnow, in the knowledge of the fact\nthat sreven eears more, have been ad\nded to the already twenty-one or two\nyears, wh.ch have gone by since the\npaswHire of l he origl.ial bill chartering\nthe Va. & Ky.

To use a heme-!\nly com pari -on \"our caudle was burn\ning at both et.ds ' What our people\nhave a i.ght to expect, and demand if\nno more, is a t'aitutui, diligent, persist\neiit lE'irt on the part of tho present\nmai age:iieiit, to put through to com\npletion, this link from Bristol, to Cum\nberland (jap.

The Va. and Tenn Division's propor\ntion of the salary, is but little more\ntnan it paid R. L.

'J'ho question ia almost\ndailv asked. \"What w the cause of the\nunparalleled success of Vixkcak Urr\nTKlusf\" Our answer is, that they remove\nthe cause of disease, a:ul the patient re\ncovers his health. - They are the great\nblood purifier and a lifc-Kivincr principle,\na-' perfect .Renovator and Invigorator\nuf tlio svstcm. Never before ia tho\nhistory of\" the world lias a medicine boon\nt.imjHituiiled possessing tho rc-ntnrkable\nqualities of Vinkgar Hittkus in hcalin tho\nsick of cverr disease man U heir to.

Grateful Thousands proclaim Va\negab Bitters the most wonderful In\nTigorant that eTer sustained th sinking\nsjptem.\nNo Person can take these Bitters\naccording to directions, and remain long\nunwell, provided their bones are not de\nstroyed by mineral poison or other\nmeans, and vital organs wasted beyond\nrepair.\ntiilions. Remittent and Inter\nmittent FeYers, which are so preva\nlent in tho valleys jd our great rivers\nthroughout the United States, especially\nthose of tbe Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri,\nIllinois, Tennessee, Cumberland, Arkan\nsas, lied, Colorado, Brazos, Kio Grande,\nPearl, Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro\nanoke, James, and many others, with\ntheir vast tributaries, throughout our\nentire country during tho Summer and\nAutumn, and remarkably so during sea\nsons of unusual heat and dryness, are\ninvariably accompanied by extensive de\nrangements of the stomach and liver,\nand other abdominal viscera. In their\ntreatment, a purgative, exerting a pow\nerful influence upon these various or\ngans, is essentially necessary. There\nis no cathartic for \"tho purpose equal to\nDit. J. Walkek's Vixegak Bitters,\nas they will speedily remove the dark\ncolored viscid m.attcr with which the\nbowels are loaded, at the same time\nstimulating the secretions of tho liver,\nand generally restoring tho healthy\nfunctions of the digestive organs.\nFortify the body ajrainst disease\nby purifying all its Huids with Vinegar\n. Bitters. No epidemic can take hold\ni of a system thus fore-armed.\n' Dyspepsia or Indigestion, ITead\nache, Pain in the Shoulders, Coughs,\nTightness of the Chest, Dizziness, Sour\nEructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste\nin tho Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita\ntation of the Heart, Inflammation of the\nLungs, Pain in the region of the Kid\nneys, and a hundred other painful symp\ntoms, aro the offsprings of Dyspepsia.\nOne bottle will provo a better guarantee\nof its merits than a lengthy advertise\nment. Scrofula, or King's Evil, \"vThite\nSwelliups, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled Neck,\nGoitre, Scrofulous Inflammation, Indolent\nInflammations, Vcrcurial Affections, Old\nSores, Lruptious of the Skin, Koro Eyes. etc.\nIa these, as in all other constitutional Dis\neases, \"Walker's Vinkgar Bitters havo\nshown their great curatiro power nt the\nmost obstinate and intractable cases.\nFor Inflammatory and Chronic\nRheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit\ntent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases of\ntho Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,\nthese Bitters have no ecual. Such Diseases\naro caused by Vitiated Blood.\nMechanical Diseases. Persons cn-\ngaged in Paints and Minerals, such as\nPlumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters, tad\nMiners, as they advance in life, are subject\nto paralysis of tbo Bowels. To guard\nftgainst this, take a dose of Walker's Vis\nEGAR Bittkrs occasionally.\nFor Skin Diseases, Eruptions, Tet\nter, Salt-Itheum, Blotches, Spots, Pimples,\nPustules, Boils, Carbuncles, King-worms,\nScald-head, Soro Eyes. Erysipelas. Itch,\nScnrfr, Discoloration of the Skin, Humors\naud Diseases of the Skin of wbaterer name\nor nature, are literally dujr up and carried\nout of the system iu a short time by tbe use\nof these Bitters. - \"\nPin, Tape, and other \"Worms,\nlarking ia tbe system of so many thousands,\nare effectually destroyed and removed. So\nsystem of medicine, no vermifuges, no an\nthelminitlcs will free the system from worms\nlike these Bitters.\nFor Female Complaints, in young\nor old, married or single, at tbe dawn of wo\nmanhood, or the turn of life, these Tonic\nBitters display so decided au influence that\nimprovement is soon perceptible.\nCleanse the Vitiated Blood when\never you find its impurities bnrstiug through\nthe skin in Pimples, Eruptions, or Sores;\ncleanse it when you find it obstructed and\nsluggish in the veins ; cleanse it when it is\nfoul ; your feelings rill tell voa when. Keep\nthe Llood pure, and tbe health of the system\nwill follow.\nIt. II. MeDOVALD b CO.,\nDruggists and Gn. Apt.. San Francisoo, California,\nand cor. of Washington nnd Charlton Sta X.

His\ncareer in Congress was short, but\nuncommonly brilliant. He spoke\noften from his place in the House, and\noccassionally other places; but the\nart of reporting was then imperfect,\nand moreover, stung by a defective\nreport of his speeches ,' he affronted\nthe reporters by -isit\"mg upon their\nhsads the imperfection of the art,\ntehing them \"not to attempt again\nto pi.ss upon the public their infernal\ngibberish for his English,\" so that,\nbetween tbe two, few of his speeches\nwere picseived.\nTom Marshall left Congress in a\ngreat huff witM Mr Clay, jvho, it ap\npears, had taken offense at some of\nof Tom's speeches and votes, which\ndid not fall within tbe party lines as\ndrawn by the great Whig leader.\nIitsabordination was an offense Mr.\nClay never overlooked. To aggravate\nthe offense, Tom repeated It when he\ngot hoiite-, so that Mr. Clay presently\nfound like the mm who sowed good\nsceJ, that ah enemy had been sowing\ntares among hi wheat. Less patient\nthan he of the parable,\nTHE WHIG EMBODIMENT\ndetermined not to let bdth grow until\nharvest, but to gathtr lip tires forth\"\nwith. One morning accordingly he-\nstepped into the office of tbe Lexing\nton Osberver nnd KejwrVcr. and hartd\ning a short notice, written m his own\npeculiar nbat hand to Mr. 1. 0.\nickjiffc, tile editor, requested huh\nto iuscrt It in the next number of his\npaper. \"Certainly, Mf.. Clay,\" re\nplied Mr. Wickliffe. \"But you have\nnot read it.\" said Mr. Clay. \"Head\nit ; perhaps you will not approve of\nit.\" Mr. Wickliffe, with A courteous\ncxpress dn j then read tnc notice;\nwhich he sa ttt a glance, ns he nan\nalready seen in the eye and port ot\n& TENNESSEE\nits author, portered mischief to the\nknot of young insubordinates beaded\nby Marshall, Though' short, it was\nvery significant, importing that on a\ncertain day, two or three weeks dis\ntant, Mr. Clay would address the\npeople at the court-bouse in Lexing\nton on the principles and measures of\nthe Whig party, which of late had\nbeen the subject of animadversion\nin various quarters. Such .was the\nimport, but the words and collation\nunmistakably bespoke the hand of\nMr. Clay. Wickliffe till the day of\nhis deajh could repeat the notice\nword for word. It duly appeared in\ntho Observer and Reporter, a few\nhours after which Toir Marsh 11\nentered the office. Wick'.iffe's mid\nble name was Carmichael, from\nwhich his friends nicknamed him\n\"Mike.\" -Mike,' said Tom, with the\ntossing of the head Yftich betokened\nhim Wry sure ot ' his scent, \"who\nwtoto that note at the head of your\ncolurn this morning?\" \"Who wrote\nit?\" answered Wickliffe, evasively,\n4 why it appears as editoml.\" \"I\nknow, it.' replied Tom, \"But you\ndidn't write it. Tell, me didn't Mr;\nClay write that himself? \"Well\nsaid Mr. Wickliffe, \"to be frank with\nyou, Mr. Marshall, he did.' 'I knew\nit,' exclaimed Tom, with an oath,\n\"and he means me !' addirg with an\nother oath, \"and I intend to answer.'\nNothing more was needed to put the\nwhole community on tiptoe of expecta\ntion. THE EXCITEMENT WAS G RE T,\nand grew until the appointed day,\nwhich saw the flowers of the papula\ntion of the Blue Urass region as\nsembled in and around the Lexington\ncourt-house to witness an intellectual\ncombat Voutmvce between the im\nperious leader and his gifted but\nrefractory yong subaltern. The pub\nlic interest was wrought up to a pitch\nalmost painful. Mr. Clay began his\nfipcech. Tom Marshall was present,\nstationed upright in a remote win\ndow slightly back of .Mr. . Clay's\nposition, where he thought Mr, Clay\nwould not Fee him. But he was\nmistaken. The '-Great Commoner':\nwan in an excellent plight, and spoke\nin his happiest veui, with even more\nthan his usual head of magnetic\npower.enchanting and fairly electrif y\nnZ the multitude, not excepting\nMar .hall himself, who, dia vu by\ni nwitting sympathy with the speaker,\nl ad leaned forward frui his \"coigne\nof vantage\" until his tall figure stood\nin full view. At thb point M , Ciay,\nbavins come to the subject cf the\nclique of which Marshall was chief,\nclosed a withering sentence by turn\ning around suddenly tip n Tom. and\nhulfins his look, voice, and gesture\nin one electric mis-ile at tbe .p;ll\nbound, culprit, who shot back into\nthe window as if stiuct? with a can\nnon ball or as if discharged from the\ncannon's mouth. His demoralization\nwas complete. Mr. Clay concluded\namid a tumult of applause. upon\nwhich arose everywhere lottd shouts\nof \"Marshall.\" But Marshall did not\nappear. Marshall was not to be\nfound. II:s followers had nothing to\ndo but retire leaving Mr. Clay un\ndisputed possession of the fit-Id a\nmovement which thev executed, we\nmav be sure, with ill-concea'.ed dis.\ngust at the conduct of their recreant\nchampion. I he next morning loin\nMarshall, according to his custom,\nstalked into tbe office of the Observer\nawl Reporter.\n'Well, Mike,' said he, \"I reckon\nyou trunk Mr. Clay made a iireat\nspeech yesterday?'\n\"Yes.' replied Mr. Wickliffe, \"I\ndo don't you?'\n'Not as treat as he could have\nmade said Tom, with a meaning\nlook. \"If I had spoken and rowI.?d\nhim up as I could have done, and he\nhad come back at me as he would\nhave done, then vou would have\nheard a great speech.'\n\" Jut why rlid nt vou speax, Mr.\nMarshall?4 asked Wickliffc.\n\"Became,' cried Tom with bitter.\nemphasis, 'I was a coward!

The truth is, Tom Marshall1\nalways felt the moral mastery of Mr;\nClay, and almost always chafed under\nit to such a degree .that his well\nknown estrangement from that leader\nof men wr, at bottom, probably\nowing as much to this one cause as to\nall other cafises united.'

DUPRE,\nwhich may give some light as to the\nErobable cause and effect of tho distur\nsantes . I'rofes' jr Dupre is a native\nborn arid educated Virginian, though\nfor several years has tilled with dis\ntinguished ability the chair of natural\nscience of Wollord college, Spartans-\nburg, S. C. He is regarded as one of\nthe most accomplished geologists i li\nthe Soutn, and as a scientist, has a\nreputation second to ho man in this\ncountry. At the first report of the\nBald mountain disturbance he set out\nwith the senior clas of Wofford col\nlege to explore and analyze the new\nwonder. We first met his party on\nStone mountain, where we asked for\nfeii interview' the next day at Chimney\nRock, which was kindly granted.\nProfessor Dupresaid, when we asked\nprofessionally his opinion in regard to\nthe nature of the disturbances, that\nfrom his limited observations, and the\nshort space of time he had been on the\nmountains, he was unprepared to ex\npress his views fully, especially as the\nd'sturbauces were strictly volcanic iu\ntheir actions, and yet to be po, would\noverthrow the foundation and princi-\nf)Ies of geology. In the first place, t-aid\nic, \"Vr-h-anoes, heretofore, have al\nways bordered the sea, and have only\noccurred near rice p waters. None has\never occurred farther than fifty miles\nfrom deep wters on the sea coast, and\nthere is no theory that would indicate\nvolcanic action in t he Appalachian\nchain, the tiearfst point of which to\ntho sea is two hundred and fifty miles,\nand at that point the water is shallow.\nMoveovcr there lias never been even\nany reported 'eruption, east of the\nRocky mountains and none on the\nAtlantic coast. These facts have es\ntablished the main foundation of geo\nlogical theory and if tlne disturban\nces are volcanic (which I firmly be\nlieve) it creates a new epoc'i in geo\nlogical science that will doubtless at\ntract the attention of scientists of the\nCivilized world.

In reply to our question as t wheth\ner o'F not. I liese rumbling noises or\ntremblings were indicative of earth\nquakes, he said, '\"rumbling noises are\ncommon as premonitory sj thptoiriS of\nboth earthquakes and volcanoes, hut\nthe explosive sounds that I nave\nheard to-day nnd yesterday are com\nmon only to and characteristic of vol\ncanoes.\"\nProf; Dupro nho said that \"the noise\nmade in the mountain is of the eract\ndescription of the sounds that pro\nceeded from Mt. btna previous to an\neruption. He adopts Prof. Agassiz's\ntheory, thrtt the centre of the earth is\na molton niass, that tidal waves of fire\nconstantly roll through it like waves\nof the ocean; t hat the crust of the earth\nat its thinnest point is only twelve\nmiles thick; that these waves of fire\nand heat niclt off portions of thiscrust\nat its thinnest point until finally the\ncrust ii broken through and the fire\nfrom below pours out.\"\nVe will Ktate that the shocks and\ntremblings are becoming less frequent\nand severe, though the inhabitants\nwhen we left to-day (Friday) werestill\nuneasy and undecided what to do,\nwhether to remain or stay in the vi\ncinity.

To\nprepare the bed, I spade up stiihcient\nspace, which should ne of rich yellow\nearth, and raised several inches high.\nI then put on a irood layer of etaldc\nmanure, tlle'i rich earth about one\niu.Vh thiclY,' then the potatoes, ab\"ut J\ninch apart, fhtn iU h earth\" again.\nfiuishing with , .1 heavy coating of\nmanure. As oor. as the potato begin\nto sprout, tb tap-coating of. manure\nshouid he takeu oif, and njiore earth\nwell pulverised put on.'\nIn the next place, I select land of a\ndark color - where there is hut little or\nno, rc'llay. .

Thi\nNo! 448\nNo. 32. . :\nnext plowing is done, with a turning\nplow, put in the furrow made, by . the\nbull-t ingue, throwing the dirt to the\npotatoe, find this plowing continued\ntill the middles are broken out, and\never afterward cultivated with sweep\nand hoe.\ni As to gathering-after the first frost,\nif the ground n not wet, 1 gather my\ncrop haul the potatoes where I ex\npect to bank them, and if the weather\npermits -I let them lay out three or\nlour days, in piles of about ten bushels\neach taking care to cover them at\nnight, and tearing down the pi'esevery\nmorning. This process is continued\ntill the potatoes ccae to sweat, nnd\nthen propel ly bunked away, where\nthey will remain good for -0 months.\nMany wait till several floats have\nfallen. This plan, I think, is a ruinous\none, as I believe all of the sap of tbe\nvine makes back to the potato as oon\nas the frost touches it; in which case,\nyou have a watery J'orxto .to eat till\nthey.all rot, which-they willdo.no\nmatter how well you put them up.\nThe low beds retain the rain, while\nthe high, drawn-up beds become a\ndry as povi dt r, nnvf are never v et two\ninches deep by the heaviest rains.\ntherefore plow deep, and low bed will\nmake your potatoes.

Its mar\nket reports are voluminous and\ncarefully gotten up.\nIt is confidently believed hcarca\nbonts, that in speaking about \"the\nway Ward's ducks went,\" prophet\nic refferencc, was made to old Mrs.\nWard in Greenville, and that she\nmeans to follow her ducks in spite\nof all the psalms the crusaders caul\nsing in front of her whiskey shop.\nJudge A. Mahcod of the 14th\nCircuit, has resigned, the resigna\ntion to take effect on the 1st inst.\nNext comes Knoxville, through\nits Pbees and Hebald, and raps\nits neighbors of the little hill city,\nover the \"face and eyes,\" with a\ncopy pf the Bristol News, aud tells\nthem how well Bristol managed it.\nHere is what it says in last Wednes\nday's issue.\nBristol rejoices that the efforts of her\npublic-spirited citizens for the estab\nmerit of a cotton factory in the town,\nhave been crowned with success.\nThe News of this week gives the par\nticulars, and states that the factory\nwill be built and completed this\nSpring and Summer. This is enter\nprise in the richt direction and the\nexample of Bristol might well be em\nulated by more pretentious communi\nties in East Tennessee.\nTwo young gentlemen recently\nwished to fight a duel at Ilinton,\nWest Va., but as they either had\nto 6tand in the river, or wait\nuntil a level bit of ground could be\ngraded in the side of the Canyon,\ntheir ardor cooled, and blood was\nsaved. Time works wonders.\nSenator Pridemore is thus re\nferred to by the Ilichinond corres\npondent of the Petersburg News:\nNearly every time Senator Pride\nmore, of Lee, gets the lloor he takes\noccasion to remark upon the wish of a\ncertain portion of the Southwest to\nsecede from Virginia and either hook\non to Kentucky or form a new State.\nThe Knoxville Chronicle com\nplains that Knoxville is discrimina\nted against in the matter of\nfreights.\nNew York is holding meetings,\nurg'ng incremation, or the burning\nof human bodies, instead of the\nusual method of burying their.\nGold 113$ ia New York.\nBRISTOL\nINVITES\nTI.ES.\nSET-\nIndticcineuts to Seek a Home\nin Upper East Tennessee.\nTo persons wishing to change their\nlocation, the following statement of\nfacts may be of advautage:\n1st. Tbe climate is temperate, being\nfree from the rigors of Northern win\nter and the extremes of summer heat\na more salubrious atmoephere is no\nnere lounu no sucu thing as mala\nria The soil and climate together.\nadapted to probably a greater variety\nof products, thau any other in the\nU.ilon. 'liiDber or all kinds abund\nantit is the land of springs. Water\npower sufficient to turn the machiue\nry of the world. Iron and Coal, inex\nhaustible. No country more suscepti\nble in native resources.\n2ud. The substratum, the bone and\nsinew of society are of Scotch-Irish\ndescentthe highest type of the Cau\ncasian race comparatively few of Af\nrican descent, and they are gradually\nretiring. Such is tbe material of socie\nty, that the country is compelled to be\nconservath-e in religion and politics.\n3rd. Educational and Church facil\nities, are to bo had in all the towns and\nimportant neighborhoods. King Col\nlege, under tiie management of tbe\nPresbyterian denomination, in Bris\ntol, on the line of It. R.. though foun\nded since the war, has already acquired\na sufficient endowment as to render\nthe enterprise no longer precarious,\naud is rapidly taking position among\nthe best Colleges of the land.\n4th. Lauds can be bought on rea\nsonable terms. Owners of large estates\nfind it unprofitable and vexatious, to\ncultivate their lands with the present\nunreliable system of labor, and are\ntherefore inclined to make sale of at\nleast portions of their estates.\n5th. I migrants, such as will add\nanything to the country, either so\ncially or materially., will receive a\nwarm welcome and share, in the sym\npathies of the people,\nif any one reading the above should\ndesire further information ai d more\ndefinite in regard to the section of\ncountry designated they May address,\nE. 11.

I\nMrs. Orleana B.Hale, wife ofF. P.\nHale, ami daughter of Charles and\nIthoda Gentry, wto fa former davs re\nsided near Uandrldge, East Tennes\nsee.\nSister Orleans sought the Savior ear\nly, and was baptised -hy Elder William\nCate, in 18-58, nmS remained a devoted\nmerWberofthe Baptist Church up to the\ntime of her death ; married F. P, Hale,\nApril, 1852. Her disease was rather\ncomplicated, she was confined to her\nbed for some six weeks. She had pre\nsentiments of her early departure, even\nbefore her confinement. She bore her\naffliction with a christian fortitude,\nand was heard to say \"not my will,\nO Lord, but thine be done.\" Shedied\na peaceful, happy, and triumphant\ndeath. Her prayer was, that she\nmight die easy, aud in her Hgiitmind.\nIn this she was gratified. The writer\nknew her from her School daj-s up to\nthe day of her death, always loved\nher, but more in her death than while\nliving seeing a fuller development of\nher christian graces, how beautiful\nwas her transit from earth to heaver.\nShe was a kind mother, affectionate\nwife, and a good neighbor. She leaves\nbehind her a heart ctricken husband,\nix children, many relatives and\nriends, to mourn her death. A few\ndays before her death she called to\nher bed side, her husband, with all\nthe children, taking each one by tbe\nhand, and admonishing them how to\nlive, and telling Viem to prepare to\nmeet her in heaven, bidding them\nfarewell, as though she was going a\njourney on earth. And the morning\nbefore her death, after struggliing with\nthe monster death all night, just at\nthe dawn ef day, a pleasant smile\nnoon her couuteuance, and wishful\nlook, and when asked what did she\nsee. She replied, I see something\nwhite shaking beyond the waters, I\nsee Jesus' be has been with me\nthrough the n'ght. Tbe deceased pos\nsessed fine qualities of mind, and\nheart, which made her very dear to\nall who knew her. From her bril\nliant eye, beamed intelligence sinceri\nty, humor, and affection. She was\nstrong and firm in her attachments of\npure aud lofty character. She con\ndemned everything low, and loved the\ngood, the pure and elevated. Natur\nally cheerful and refined by divine\ngrace, in all her struggle and agony,\nnot a murmur fell from ner lips. A\nbright light is gone to shine as a star\nin the firmament above. Then O\nbereaved ones, ye sorrow, not as oth\ners who have no hope. Remember,\nthat those who sleep in Jesus, will God\nbring with him. Comfort one another\nwith these words.\nZ. L. BURSON.\nJonesborough papers please copy.\nKlcumond.\nGovernor KKMrEit, in his message\non the public debt , slates, that should\nthe city of Richmond continue to\nincrease in the ratio of the past, the\nrevenue to be derived at existing\nrates, from that city alone, \"will, in\na few decades, be sufficient to dis\ncharge the unpaid interest and cover\nthe present deficiency u: the treas\nury.\" This is very true , and is one\nof the strongest reasons why the peo\nple of Virginia should do all that can\nbe done to facilitate the growth o\nRichmond.

About 30 per cent, of\nthe latter has never been patented, al\nthough occupied by squatters for a num\nber of years.\nIt will probably be late In the fall before\na judgment can be entered in court as a\nresult of legal proceedings Corporation\nCounsel W. 13.

So great is the\ndisplay affordeded' for an apprecia\ntive public instruction that no less\nthan twelve massive centre poles are\nrequired to exhibit it properly. The\nnew and original idei of a double\ncircus performance is not only\nfelicitous and happy, but strikes the\nbeholder as a decided innovation npon\nthe old order of things .

Electricity\nis in the blood, the brain, the nerves : it flows throughout the\nbody and is that warm force given oy Nature. To replenish this\npower when lost by disease is the work of my new and scientific\napplication. In this way I promote circulation and nerve action,\ndrive out pain and completely cure your ailment. For Rheuma\ntism, Lumbago, Weakness of all kinds. Varicocele, Drains, etc.,\nthere is no remedy at all comparable with it.\nNY BEITS DO NOT BURN ANYONE\nFor more than ten years 1 have been using an extra special\ncovering for my discs, so arranged that the same may be worn on\nthe body with or without this covering, at the option of the\nwearer. Other advertisers claiming that they alone furnish such\ncovers with their Belts, simply print falsehoods.\nBUY NO BEITS\nWhich require immersion in strong vinegar or other acids for\ncharging purposes. Such belts last the wearer less than a month.\nAll my Belts carry a special guarantee with them for their lasting\nqualities, and any repairs needed occasionally are made free of\ncharge.\nTHIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE PUBLIC\nConstantly, as my Dr. Sanden Belts, with attachments, have\nbeen, ought to be enough evidence to sufferers that dealing with\nme they run no chances of dangerous experiments. Is it not\nbetter to use my Belt, under my own experienced advice, than to\nuse that of some other person whose name you never heard of a\nyear or so ago ?\nAt least all owe it to themselves to examine my Belts and\nappliances before purchasing those of other makes. I will acco\nmodate anyone to make this examination of my Belts at their\nown homes if they will but ask it.\nCall tr Write for my \"THREE CLASSES OF HEN.\"\nSANDEN ELECTRIC CO.,\n167 Fourth St., Russel Building, Portland, Or.\nSeattle Branch, Room 409 Washington Bnlldlni.\nSINS OF THE FATHER.\nMb Oh* Ml Thin Is a true statement of a nitMl\nHD vD* lyn law.

Ma th 30. Some\nmention has been made of the new\nOrder of Enoch which Britiham\nYoung is endeavoring to introduce\namong his saints. The subject, how\never, ha -not received that attention\niu the East W hich it merits, foretell\ning, ns it docs, to the minds of all in\ntelligent persons in this territory, the\ndownfall of Mormonism. The attempt\nto establish the order is, indeed, the\nfirst confession of weakness which\nBrigham Young has made for many\nyears. He sees and hears, ns perhaps\nno man else can see and hear, and\npolygamy in Utah is in its death\nthroes, and with the corner-stone of\nMormonism pone, the edifice itself\nmust surely fall. What remains then,\nbut for the old man prudent to gather\nin what he can for the remnant of his\ngoods, and take his departure to hap\npier climes, where the Gentiles shall\ncease from troubling, and he may die\nat peace? Many things have conspired\nto seal the fnte of Mormonisni. First\nand foremost perhaps is the settled an\ntipathy of the nation to the practice of\njmlygamy. The miseries which are\nits legitimate fruits, have beeu brought\nhome to every intelligent reader\nthroughout the land by newspapers\nand books. Then again the religion of\nthe Prophet is based solely upon thr\nignorance of his followers. To pre\nserve its power, it was necessary t j\nkeep them still ignorant. lue gentile\nmust be kept from the flock. But the\nGentile has pushed his way in, and\nthe time has passed by whec a murder\nor two judiciously executed served to\npreserve the purity of the fold. The\nGentile has brought knowledge with\nhim that terrible, tite of evil and\ninany saints have eaten thereof, and\ntheir eyes I a e ibaen ope.ied. The\nground 'is fairly trembling under the\nProphet's feet, and he knows not\nat what hour at what minute the\nchasm may be opened and the Church\nof Latter Day Saints engulfed.\nUnder these circumstances, true to\nhis ancient faith iu the efficacy of\nworldly comforts, Brighanj naturally\nturns about to see how he may prepare\nhimself to meet the coming blow. HiR\nkingdom is crumbling and his sceptre\nis passing away ; but'it may still be\npermitted the old man to die in the\nmidst of plenty. His declining years\nmay still be sweetened by the enloy\nment of the good things of life. Per\nhaps by some other great Salt Lake\nand in some other garden spot of this\ngreat continent he may pitch his tent\nand gather around him a new band of\nsaints. Thousands of his followers\nscattered about in the fertile fields of\nthis lovely valley still cling to him\nand revere him as an emissary of the\nmost high God. It is still left him to\nspeculate upon their weakness for his\nown profit, and accordi ugly the Proph\net proceeds to speculate. This ia how\nhe does it : Towards the end of Feb\nruary the President Prophet held two\nmeetings of the faithful at St. George,\nand there he first proposed to them\nthe new departure which the saints\nwere to make for the sake of the\nChurc'i. According to the Bible\nEnoch was taken up to heaven with\nout that prelimiuiuary passage through\nthe dark vale which ordinary mortals\nare forced to make. The prophet.\ngoes further than the Bible, and as\nsures his people that not only Enoch\nbut the \"City of Enoch\" entire was\nthus taken up to God. This, Brigham\nassures the saints, was an especial fa\nvor granted to the Eijochites because\nof their superabundance of godliness.\nThe phrase would somewhat obscure\nbut for the explanation which the\nProphet kindly -jives to his people.\nThe first step, according to this high\nauthority, toward attaining to the\ngodliness of Enofh is too deed all their\nproperty in trust to the trustee of the\nChurch of Christ of Latter Day Saints.\nWhen they have thus impoverished\nthemselves they are appointed stew\nards of the Church (i.e., Brigham\nYoung), and are members of the Or\nder of Enoch. This stewardship, as\nexpounded by Brigham, is in itself\npeculiar. The saint is appointed to ex\nercise hla jurisdiction whither the\nChurch dictates. He may be ap\npointed to cultivate his own farm or\nhe may be established on his neigh\nbor's. Of the fruits of his labor he i\nheld to a strict accountability. The\nprofits belong not to him but to the\nChurch of the Latter Day Saints. In\nshort, he becomes simply a steward\nperhaps servant would be the better\nword to the Prophet, to whom he has\nturned over not only all right to his\nworldly possessions but the right to be\nmaster of his own actions. Where\nthey shall live, what they shall do, and\nhow they shall do It i decided en\ntirely by the Mormon priests; and\nk TENNESSEE TUESDAY APRIL 14,\nthus relieved trom all worldly cares\nthe Enochite will have a single beait\nto give to the Charch, and at some fu\nture day may hope to take a trip to\nheaven by the easterly current.\nThe effect of this Order of Enoch\nupon the oor dupes who bow the\nknee to Brigham Young can be easily\ncomprehended. The man of property\ngives up his all to begin with, and re\nnounces his right to acquire iu the fu\nture. The man who owns nothing\ncontributes the fruits of his labor, and\nshould he leave the order twenty years\nfrom now he must do it without a\ncent which he can call his own.\nIu the constitution of this Order of\nEnoch a provision was made apparent\nly in good faith for the well-being of\nthe members. No money was to be ta\nken from the treasury, unless by the\ncommon voice and consent of the order\nBrigham also introduces iu his order\nthis clause.\nAnd thli ihall be common roiee and consent of th\norder : that any man among you ay onto the treas\nurer. \"1 hae ned of this to help me in my stew\nardship ;\" if It be eve telent. or if it be ten tal\nents, or twenty talents, or flfty, or a hundred, the\ntreasurers hall jjir. unto bim tliotara which b'\nrequire to help him in his Ktewardship,\nand to long a be i in fall fellowship, a.id ia faith\nful, the treasurer shall hot withhold,\nThis all looks very fair, and is suc\nceeding admirably in gulliug the more\ncredulous of the faithful. But does\nany one who knows Brigham Young\nbelieve that one penny upon which he\ngets his grasp will ever leave it? This\nwhole scheme ia very transparent to\nthose in whom bliud devotion ha9 not\nblinded the action of common sense.\nThe Prophet inaugurated his proceed\nings iu this matter far up in the coun\ntry, where the reigu of ignorance iu\nperpetual.

Mr. Milburn, the\n\"Blind Preacher\" of our time. All\nthe evening we caught our fancy\ncheating us into the delusion that we\nwere attending a' rehearsal of Wirt's\nprose poem, ami in spite of ourselves\nour thoughts would continually repeat\nthe refrain: \"Socrates died like a\nPhilosopher; but Jesus Christ like a\nGod.\" The infirmity of the preacher\ndeeply impressed us. His slow and\ndeliberate manner in approaching the\npulpit, those sightless eyeballs, vacant\nand expressionless, with the fixed gaze\ninto vacancy, excited our warmest,\nsympathy; and the liveliest interest\nwas awakened ere he had even spo\nken, when we looked around upon the\nvast congregation of iutcllisenl ind re\nfined ladies and gentlemen who\nthronged the church 10 overflowing,\nto think that all was a dreary waste of\ndarkness before him, and that his only\nconsciousness of the presence of the\nvast multitude was from the subdued\ntramp of feet and rustle of garments.\nThen he opened his mouth aud spoke ;\nand his voice, at first low aud sweet,\nmodulated to a modest and subdued\nmeasure as be gavo fourth the number\nand page of a well known hymn, sud\ndenly rose to full round tones, when\nhe lined it forth in a burst of deepest\npathos and tenderest expression, so\nharmonious with our sympathies for\nhis sightless sorrows. The lesson of\nthe evening was Paul s matchless den\nnition of charity ; and this, too, was\nfeelingly and correctly read ; and then,\nafter a praver, his text was taken In\n\"Ecclesiastes.\" The sermon was a\npowerful and beautiful discourse ou\nthe vanities of human J ife full of gor\ngeous imagery, of realistic illustiations,\nand apt application of his theme,\nwhich, while captivating the senses by\ntheir beauty; carried conviction to the\nmind by their force and truthfulness\nWarming with this subject, he grew in\nearnestness until lie seemed to com\nimine with the angels that were dis\nclosed to the vision of his mind aud\npour forth his very soul in the rapture\n. . a\not ins eloquence; ana asne reacneu\nthe climax of bis peroation ana ciosea\nwith a grand antithetical illustration\nof the vanities of this world contrasted\nwith the substantial rewards prepared\nfor the just made perfect in the world\nto come, how our thoughts reverted to\nthat \"Blind Preacher\" of the past,\nthe favorite of our school-boy days,\nand how we coveted the genius and\ngraces of a Wirt that we, too, might\nimmortalize the hero of this hour and\neternize his theme. But, though there\nmay be many \"blind preachers,\" there\nis but one V irt. and meditating upon\nthe scene ns we left the church, in\nstinctively we found our heart re-echo\ning his grand refrain, \"Socrates died\nlike a philosopher; but Jesus Christ\nlike a God 1\"\nSuppliant South Carolina.\nIt will doubtless surprke most of\nyour readers to hear that among the\npleasantest of the many interviews\nwhich the di 'crates hate had here\npublicnicn were those with Ceneral\nwith William Tecuin.-eh Shernnn and\nGen.

C Fowler, Esq.\nDear Sir: You have my thanks\nfor the kind terms in which vou com\nmunicate to me the proceedings of the\nlate public meeting of the people of\nWashington County, unanimously\ncommending my action on the Peters\nburg charter bill. The approval of the\npeople of the great and intelligent\nCounty of asbington. the locality\nInch, worthily and before all ochers\non the Aniericac Continent, received\nthe name of the Father of\nhis Country, is a reward for duty done\nof which any public servant might be\njustly and uualiectenly proud.\nYou are mistaken however, in sup\nposing that any wound may have been\ngiven to m3r feelincs, by the personal\nasperities which, in unexceptional in\nstances, have been visited upon my\nofficial action. While no man esti\nmates more highly or cherishes more\ngratefully, the connnence and appro\nval of ins fellow citizens, 1 yet hold\nthat duty, when it it is done faithfully\nin the fear of God and not in the fear\nof inau, done effectually despite 'a tide\nyFirtitif and i otnrni fif rnniriiAQ \"\ncarries with it its own reward which\nis more to be prized than the applause\nof the world, htanriingin thesirength\nof my convictions of duty, I have ob\nserved with composure the assaults\nj'ou mention, without having expe\nrieuced one moment oi excitement or\none sentiment o( bitterness towards\nmy assailants. Certainly I shall\nnever pause iO notice, sti.I less stoop\nto answer, any question of the purity\nof the motives which inspire my offi\ncial action. In view of the great po\nlitical crisis through which we are\npasiiug. in view of the necessity for\nrecuring and adhering to fundamental\nprinciples in such a period, all meiely\nindividual interests, and all personal\nclamor and misconstruction, dwindle\ninto insignificance.\nIt must never be conceded, for it is\nnot true, that the civil war has de\nstroyed however it may have invaded,\nany or the rights of the States or of the\npeople, or any of the vital princi\nples of American liberty. We have\npassed the epoch which marked the\nemancipation aud enfranchisement of\nour late slaves, tne removal ot tne ele\nment which broke the homogenie4y\nand the harmony of I he States and sec\ntions, but ourselves have lost no sin\ngle article of the liberties which as\nfreemen we inherited from our fathers.\nThe area of thecommon liberties has\nbeen enlarged without in validating fr\nthe future the title, the tenure or the\nquality of the freehold.\nThe new constitutional order differs\nfrom the old iu that it incorporates our\nlate slave in the body politic, ns citi\nzens, and clothes them with the same\npolitical rights which aforetime at\ntached exclusively to the whi'e race.\nThis great change -was sudden and\nrevolutionary. It was undoubtedly\nrepugnant to the cherished traditions\nand sentiments of the masses of\nthe white people. Without any of\nthat preparation for the duties and\nresonsibilities of citizenship which the\nfounders of the government held to be\nessential to its purity and safety, the\ncolored people, unenlightened, unedu\ncated, just emerging from the debase\nment of siavcry. were in a moment in\nvested with a full proportion of the\npower to control the'government, and\nto determine great questions of life,\nliberty and property. But however\nprecipi a'ory the change may have\nbeen made, however hazardous or uu\nwelcome to any portion of the people,\nit has been conciliated in the organic\nlaw of the Union and of the States; it\nis acquiesced i:: as a finality by all sec\ntions and parties ; wo have ourselves\naccepted it as a fundamental condition\nunderlying the existence of the State\nas a restored member of the Union ;\nevery officer aud representative with\nin the State is bttund by the constitu\ntional oath to recognize the equality of\nall men before the law ; and in view\nof actual results, it would be as wise\nto attempt to turn back ward the course\nof time and events as to quarrel or\nrepine over the unalterable past.\nThe people of Virginia intelligently\nrealize the results of war ; aud it is by\nfairly conforming to the necessities of\nthe \"situation, and by pecuring equal\nrights, liberty and justice to all men,\nthat they hope to obtain enduring\npeace aud build up a prosperous Com\nmonwealth In passing through such a period of\ntransition, no counsels of violence,\nnothing but tho forecast and prudence\nof a calm statesmanship, can guide us\nlo safety. We must again and at all\nhazardous, erect the original land\nmarks of the pure and timple republi\na miifirww\ncanism of Jefferson\nWe have no se\ncurity but in cleaving to the funda\nmental principles of free government.\nIt is to be expected that special and lo\ncal grievances will sometimes result\nfrom the novel and abnormal circum\nstances of the situation. In such ease\nes passion looks alone to the particular\ngrievance, and urges violent correc\ntives which would so remedy a special\nevil for the present as to imperil the\nrights of all for the future. But it is\nthe duty of the Statesman, while de\nploring and condemning live special\nwrong and sympathising with its vic\ntims, to oppose himself unflinchingly\nto the passions of the hour, to take care\nthat no rash remedy fo.- temporary aud\nparticular evil shall jeopardize the safe\nty of the whole people, yet at the same\ntime to apply with a lirm band the\nmost efficient corrective to be devised\nin harmony with the organism of\nAmerican constitutional liberty.\nIn maintaining the views, we neces\nsarily maintain the avowed principles\nand aims of the conservative party.\nThej' are parcel of it? faith. They are\nin strict consonance with every au\nthoritative announcement of its pur\nposes. What ia of less but of some\nsignificance, they accord with my\npublisK-d acceptance of the Conserva\ntive nomination for the position I now\nhold. They but reproduce the senti\nments I uttered aud emphasized, in\nthe late canvass, before great masses\nof the people in every section of\nthe State : and they harmonize with\nsuch of my official messages and with\nsuch joint resolutions of the General\nAssembly as have relevancy to them\nit nas been iaiseiy supposed by a\nfew that the Conservative party was\nnothing more than a combination of\nwhite people, organized on the idea of\n\"white aga;nst black,\" for the sole\npurpose of perpetuating tho party su\npremacy of race. Everywhere in the\nlate canvass I denounced that policy;\nand my review of it, which met with\ngeneral aecepiance, was, in brief, to\nthe following effect : That at the close\nof the var, and years before the Con\nservative party was formed, political\nadventurers had taken the colored peo\nple in hand as their pretended friends\nand deliverers ; had by promises of con\nfiscation of private property, and by\ninfiamatory appeals, fired them against\ntheir former masters ; united them in\nan oath-bound political party solely\nupon the principle of antagonism to\nthe native white race ; and had voted\nthem almost in mass in 1869 in favor\nof the disfranchisement and test-oath\niniquities which, if adopted, would\nhaveshni out the great body of the\nivhite people from participation in the\ngovernment ; that such a policy meant\nthe degradation and virtual enslave\nment of the white race, and the usur\npation of all the powers of the govern\nment by a party organized and boun\nded by a color line ; that the Conserva\ntive party had grown out of the calam\nities and necessities of revolution, and\nwas composed of all the old parties\npatriotically united together for the\npurpose of rescuing society, civilization\nand liberty from the ruins of war;\nthat the conservative party had by\ntheir votes and their oaths in good\nfaith accepted the new constitutional\norder; that in their four years admin\nistration of the State government they\nhad emphatically recognized the equal\nity of all men before the law ; that in\ncreating a generous system of Public\nschools and in al! other legislation,\nthey had provided equally and impar\ntially for both races, aud had secured\nthe same rights and benefits to all men\nirrespective\" of color ; that their aim\nwas to break and disperse the adversa\nry color-line party, and their final\nsuccess would be the iignal tor the\ndispersion and extiuction of all race\nline combinations, would inaugurate a\nnew erea when colored nieu, freed from\nrace euthrallment, would come under\nthe same influence and reasons which\ngoverned other men informing party\naffiliations, when the politics of our\nwhole people would return to healthy\nand normal conditions, and when men\nof both :aces, combiub'g for the good\nof all, would restore peace anel a com\nmon prosperity. After a color-line\nparty had been formed. Conservatives\narrayed themselves against it to de\nstroy it; and if any man supposes that\nin thus arraying themselves, they im\nitated the very example against which\nthey waged an exterminating war. he\nmistakes the shadw for the substance\nof historical truth. If the Conserva\ntive party has effectually resisted any\nevil, it is that of the disastrous dissev\nering of the community into jarring\nand hostile classes inspired by the fa\ntal war-cry of \"black against white,\"\nor of \"white against, black.' At the\nsame time and from the same devotion\nto principle and to peace, it has resis\nted the tyrany and wickedness of any\nintermeddling with the social rela\ntions of the people, of so legislating as\nto impair or to touch the social inde\npendence of any race or class, under\nthe pretence of conferring civil rights\nso-called.\nThe Conservative party has broken\ndown all race combinations in the past\nand it will assurely never countenance\nwithin its own ranks any efforts for\ntheir renewal. No such narrow ideas\ncan ever hem in its organization. \"No\npent up utica contracts its powers.\"\nIt not only seeks to promoie the peace\nand welfara of the State by establish\ning the harmony and co-oneration of\nthe races. It is the reimbodiment of\nthose true principles of government\nwhich in earlier days gave to the States\nand the Union their purity and real\nglory. It would confirm to the States\nall their original, constitutional rights\nand powers ; it cheerfully concedes to\nthe common government the full mea\nsure of its delegates and authorities;\nit steadily resists the teudency of the\nhour towards centralization: it holds\nours to be a government of and for the\npeople, amenable to the people, with\nno powers except such as are derived\nfrom the consent of the governed ; it\nfosters harmonious and cordial rela\ntions between all the Stales as co-equal\nmembers of a restored Union, and be\ntween the States aud Common Govern\nments; in a word, its voice is a clarion\nblast which summons all men to rallv\nunder the standard of constitutioual\nfree government.\nNatioual parties have been so im\npressed, and shaped, or mis-shapen by\nthe violence of arms, that hey can\nonly be adapted to the new era of\npeace and well-regulated government\nby being either materially modified or\naltogether reconstituted. The politi\ncal elements are in process of transi\ntion. While many of them are visibly\nfloating in uncurtain waters and drift\ning around us. the Conservative party\nof Virginia stands on dry land. It\nstands on Constitutional ground, broad\nenough aud firm enough to receive\nand hold all true men of all parties.\nDie necessities of the hour incline true\nmen, of whatever past party affiliation,\nto draw together on common grouud\nIt is a great company receiving con\ntinual additions. Sooner or later such\naccretions must crystalize in the per\nfect structure of a great, natioual, con\nstitutional party of conservative ideas\nthe ideas of Jclierson, ot 31ason, of\nMadison and of Mouroe.\nI should not do justice to the whole\nof the subject-matter suggested by\nyour letter, without referring to one\nground of misconstruction to which\nour party is subjected by a few in our\nmidst. One article in the platform of\nthe party, as emphatically re-affirmed\nby the present Geceral Assembly,\ndisclaims all purpose of captious op\nposition to the present Federal admin\nistration, and manifests a desire for\nfriendly relations, on the basisof prin\nciple, by pledging our support to its\nmeasures so far as they may be just iu\ndesign and promotive of the harmony\nof the whole country. This article de\nclares at once our supreme allegiance\nto principle, and our desire to do exact\njustice as between ourselves and all\nothers, by cultivating narmomous re\nlations with the common government\nand of every department of it, and by\ni; ing precisely so far and no farther\nin that direction, than our principles\nwill let us go. The Conservative par\nty, like every other party, includes ex\ntreme men. They are more noisy than\nnumerous. They are extremists of two\nclasses, the antipodes of each other;\nand tbe great body of the people repose\nsilently between them sympathizing\nwith neither. Ihe one class treats\ntins article as a more void and mcau-\ningk'sa generality, and avows a gene\nral and determined hostility to the\npresent federal administration. The\nother seems to construe the same arti\ncle as committing us to the unreserved\nand unqualified support or the course\nof that administration, and of the sup\nposed views of its executive head,\ngenerally and iu advance. The one\nwould place us in relations of pro\nnounced antagonism, hostility and de\nfiance to that administration, while\nthe other would convert us into its\nblind partisans. The one would deal\nout indiscriminate censure, the other\nindiscriminate praise, of the whole\npolicy and conduct of the federal ad\nministratiou both its good and its bad\nits right and its wrong. The policy\nof the one would deprive us of all the\nbenefits of pacific aud conciliatory re\nlations with a government which is\nour government wielding many pow\ners within the State either for good\nor fer evil aud would embroil us iu\nuncalled-for and mischievous discord.\ncollision and bitterness ; while the oth\ner would be proue to deplore our actiou\nin resisting even the eirors of those\nwho may happen to administer the\nfederal government. The one would\nforbid all interchange of civilities be\ntween those who may happen to be\ncharged with the State and federal ad\nministrations, would have the former\nrudely and grotesquely to repel even\ncourtesy tendered by the latter, would\nconstrue the acceptance of each cour\ntesy into an unmanly surrender of\nState pride and personal independence,\nand would have an angry and impas\nsible gulf of separation between the\ntwo; while the policy of the other\nclass of extremists A-ould tend, how\never otherwise designed, to beget such\nan unlimited entente cordiale, such\ncomplete identity of action, on the part\nof the State administration aud the\nfederal, as would virtually surrender\nthe independence of the one to the\nother. The one policy promotes jar\nring and injurious discord; the other\ntends to the centralization of power\nand its absorption of State authority.\nAll acknowledge the patriotic mo\ntives, as well as Ihe distinguished ser\nvices, both in war and in peace, of\nsome of these extremists. But neither\nclass is right : both are wrong. The\nmasses of the Conservative people of\nVirginia are represented by neither.\nOur party adheres with inflexible fidel\nity to all who are and all who shall\nbecome our allies upon principle.\nWe are supremely for ideas and prin\nciples. We are not for men, and can\nnever be joined tc the personal fortunes\nof any man. Without regarding the\npast, we are ready to strike hands with\nany-and all who meet us on the ground\nof the right. Our traditions, ideas and\nprinciples will be the sovereign power\nto control our political party relations ;\nwe will support those who support\nthem, and oppose those who oppose\nthem ; and precisely to the extent to\nwinch they receive support or opposi\ntion, we will give support or opposi\ntion. We will support liberally and\ncordially as far as we can, and we will\nopposa reluctantly but decidedly,\nwhenever and wherever we must. But\nwhile maintaining the integrity and\nindependence of the conservative par\nti, justice, honor, interests, our delib\nerate party pledges and avowals, all\nrequire us to cultivate the most har\nmonious relations with the Common\nGovernment, and with every one of\nits departments, which may consist\nwith our principles.\nThese sentiments have guided me in\nthe past, they will guide in the future.\nI shall go forward as I have begruu.\nThe honor of Virginia shall suffer no\ndetriment in my keeping. The Con\nservative organization shall never be\nimpaired by my hands. I shall zeal\nously and in good faith strive for the\nmost friendly relations, the most cor\ndial co-operation, the largest recipro\ncation of benefits between ourselves\nand the federal government, which\nmay comport with our known stand\nard of right and duty. I shall contin\nue to accept and extend such courte\nsies, to take such responsib'lies, and\nto perform such Advanced acts of duty,\nas will clearly coincide with the prin\nciples and avowals of our party and at\nthe same lima promote the peace and\nprosperity of our people. 1 disdain to\nbe trammelled by tbe counsels or the\ncriticisms of extremisis of any class.\nGuided by invincible fidelity to every\npledge of a life neither short nor un\neventful, inspired by the principles of\nthe party for whose success I have\nborn such sacrifices aud labors as one\nmau could contribute, I shall endeav\nor to advance its aims by co-operating\nwith its friends and antagonizing its\nenemies, and judging, by its stand\nards, the measures and act3 of the\nfederal administration, I shall support\neverything that Is right nothing that\nis wrong.\nIhe action of the largely attended\npublic meeting, in Washington coun\nty, is one of numberless proofs that\nmy conduct of the affairs of the people\nreceives their unbought and.unpur\ncbasable approval. Bearing arduous\nresponsibilities in a critical period of\nour history, I look alone for support to\ntne nonest, disinterested and uupre\njudiced judgment of the people. I rest\nsecurely on the power of the popular\nwin. Lidt passion and violence be\nware of encountering that power.

KEMPER.\nCommauicated.\nTHE PETERSBURG CASE.\nIf the subject had been definitely dis\nposed of, I would not add a drop to the\ninundation of comments to which it has\ngiven rise. But as it is still,\" I learn,\noccupying the attention of the Public\nAuthorities, I offer my mite of opin\nion, not ou the particular mode in\nwhich the problem it presents should\nbe solved, but of the grounds on which\nits solution should turn. In my view\nthe underlying and determining con\nsideration is to be looked for, in the re\nality and extent of the grievances\nwhich any pait of our people may\nsuffer by reason of the present form\naud character of their municipal gov\nernment. Are they real and serious?\nAre the rights, the safety, . the\npeace of any considerable any in\nconsiderable number of its citizens,\ninvaded, menaced, or disturbed by or\nthrough the habitual policy or action\nof their existing municipal authori\nties? If they be. can there be, for the\nsuperior authorities of the State, but a\nsingle question, that of the lawful\npower to relieve them. Is there any\nGovernment so poor of spirit, so cruel,\nor so cowardly, as to permit a single\ninnocent citizen, to whom it owes pro\ntection, to suffer any wrong whicbi t\nis in its powei to remedy? Is not the\nmaltreatment of a single citizen or\nsubject, by a foreign power, a recog\nnized ground among civilized nations\nfor a demand of satisfaction, under\npenalty even of war itself. And hav\ning the power, aud owing the duty,\nshall a State permit within itself, any\nof its citizeus to be tyrannized over or\nabused by others, of whatever color, or\nwhatever numbers, if it have the law\nful power to protect them, which, done\nby a stranger, they would redress or\nchastise, if need be, even by arms?\nCan there be should there be, two\nopinions on the question? The State,\nwhich claims the life of its citizens\nfor its defeuce, shall it not protect them\nfrom outrage whether from within or\nwithout? In such case no fears of\nmisconstruction at home or abroad !\nno capitulation to prejudice no mis\nplaced tenderness to tne wrong-aoer,\nwhatever his. color, or whatever his\npower should deter it from the brave\nperformance of duty. There is the\nheroism there the honor! Whether\nthe oppressed be white or black or\nwhatever the color of the oppressor,\nstill the same protection to the one,\nthe same penalty to the other, should\nbe impartially, but unfalteringly ap\nplied.\nThe only question, under such cir\ncumstances, as it seems to me, is the quo\nmodo I much doubt whether the C on\nstitution d oes justify special legislation\nfor different towns. But there is noue\nI think, that where the plan\nof municipal Government in use\nhas been found to work unjustly, a\nd i Helen t one is within the clear prov\nince. and will have become the clear\nduty of the Legislature to provide. Ou\nthis common ground may not the Leg\nislature and the Governor harmonize,\nand Petersburg be relieved ?\nJUSTICE.\nBRISTOL INVITES\nTLERS.\nSET-\nInducements to Seek a Home in\nUpper East Tcnnesseo.'\nTo persons wishing to charge their\nlocation, the following statement of\nfacts may be of advantage :\n1st. 1 he climate is temperate, being\nfree from the rigors of Northern win\nter and the extremes of slimmer heat\na more salubrious atmosphere is no\nwhere found no such thing as mala\nria Tne son anu enmate mgemer,\nadapted to probably a greater variety\nof products, than any ether in the\nLMion.

Kemper upon the political\nstatus of parties and events, wid of\ncourse be read with attention by those\nuho take a special intere-t in such\nmatters, as intelligent readers gene\nrally do. The Governor s3's much\nthat is very good, and much that we\ntake pleasure in heartily commending,\nbut we entirely dissent from him\nwhen he -ays that tlire lias been no\nchange since the wr in the rights ol\nthe States and the liberties of the\npeople. We consider that the three\nlast amendments to the federal con\nstitution, acquit cii by co-ercion ,\ndestroyed the fundamental principles\nupon which this government was\ntornu d, and that the rights of the\nState and the people now, as con-\ntrusted wr.h those cmranteed\nia the original constitution, are no\nmore alike than is a pure African\nnegro compared with a pure white\nman. The great founders of the\ngovernment, if now living, would\nnever recognize such au instrument\nas their offspring, nor sanctiond it\neither, except, \"as we do, from necess\nity. Ti e present is not the government\nof our fathers, and the ILimi.toniau\nand not the Jeliersoniaii creed of\n\"State rights\" now prevails, Still,\nwe agree with\" Gov, Kemper that the\nsituation is one which we have ac\ncepted, and though we accepted it\nunder compulsion, it is nevertheless\na situation by which we -are compel!\ned to abide in good faith, however\ndistasttf'il it may be to our vieu\nand feelings concerning the proper\ngovernment of the country. The\npast is gone ; the present and t he\nfuture must be worked out with all\nthe wibdoiii and prudence we can\ncommand . Principles, not, men,\ns!:o i!d govern.\nBat this is no time to discuss ques\ntions that are calculated to impair\nhie harmony of our party, and upon\nwhich the best of men may differ\nwithout subjecting their motives, or\nfidelity to the best interests of the\nstate and party to suspicion. We\nare not extremists of either class and\nstand, and always have stood, where\nGov, Kemper says the great mass cf\nour people stand, the antipodes of all\nextremes.\nThe Index fe Appeal cuts loose,\nafter the following wild and dis\norganizing style, which the people\nof Washington have disapproved\nof and which will find a feeble echo\nelsewhere.\nBut it needless to answer riqtnarole\nwith reason. When Epiiuaim joins\nis idois, neither expostulation nor\nvituperation nor prayers nor tears\nnor anything else can reform him.\nLet him alone! Governor Kempeu\nhas crossed the Rubicon. He has\nlett Conservatism behind. He would\nremand Southside Virginia to a hope\nless enslavement to the negroes, lie\nbelongs now to our enemies, and not\nto the catagory of our friends and\nallies. He has chosen his way and\nwe say let him gang his gait. Every\nutterance he has mvde since his elec\ntion shows how far and fast he has\nstrayed from the true doctrine, in the\nfaith and fear of which he should\nrather have died, lie seems to have\nbeen fatally bitten by the ambition\nof Presidential or Vice-Presidential\nhonors which has betrayed to i idicu\nlous failure so many Southern poli\nticians. We haie heretofore resented\nthe deep wrong done by him to Pe\ntersburg ; we n;onru now the injury\nhi would fain inflict on t!ie State.\nBut while in the former instance his\nveto sufficed, the people will in turn\nveto his proposition when he tries to\nbetray them to the authors and the\narchitects of their run. AH honor\nbe to Governor Kemteu's record in\nthe war! All the more blame ntd\nshame to the policy of compromise\nand surrender which now seems\nlikely to link his name with that of\nsuch Conledcrates as Longstreet?\nThe Dispatch is always eooland\ngenerally wise.

There is no need for their\ndiscussion in the Conservative party.\nAnd we hope, as- the Governor is\nthoroughly vindicated upon the sub\nject of the veto, that the whole mat.\nter is now ended.

Great battk-s have been fought and im\nportant celgcs maintained, of which the details are\nas yet preserved only in Ihe newspapers or in the\ntransient publications of th. day, but which ought\nnow to lake their place in permanent and authen\ntic history.\nIn preparing the present edition fot the press,\nit has accordingly been the aim of the ediur.i to\nbring down the information to the latest possible\ndates, and to furnish an accurate account of the\nmost recent discoveries in science, of every fresh\nproduction in literature, and of the newest inven- 1\nlions in the practicsl arts as well as to give suc\ncinct and original record of the progress of poliical\nand historical events\nThe work has been begn after long and careful\npreliminary labor, and with the mcst ample resour\nces for carrying it on to a successful termination,\none of the original stereotype plates have been\nused, but every page has been printed on new tc\nlopxdia, with fee same plan and compass as its pre\ndecessor but with a far greater pecunuiy expen\nditure, and with such improvements in iiu compo\nsition as have been suggested by longer experience '\nand enlarged knowledge.\nThe illustrations which are introduced for the\nfirst lime in the present edition have been added\nnot fr the sake of pictorial effect, but to give\ngreater lucidity and force to the explanation in the\ntext. They embrace all branches cf scienco and\nof natural history, and depict the most fimous and\nremarkable features of scenery architecture, and\nart, as well as the various processes and mechan\nics and manufactures, '.though intended for in\nstruction rather than embelishraent, no pains have\nbeen spared to iusure their artistic excellence;\nthe cost of their execution is enormous, and it is\nbelieved they will find a weleomo reception as an\nad mire Me feature of Ihe Cyclopadia and worthy\nof us high character.\nThis work la sold to Subscribers only, payable\non delivery of each volume.

Va.\n... r April 24, J&74.\nAfter a pleasant ruli of eighteen\nhour over the pplendld rails of Ike\nA. M. & O. It. II., I found myself in\nthe narrow, but lively stre-ts of the\nCockade City, whoso lordly and wel\ncome burghers had heard of the jYcu','\nmid eome of whom met me with the\nremark, that we had \"gone for them\nci! their charter! I found my old\nfriend Gregory of the Index & Appeal\nstretched upon the rack of daily jour\n'ihlism. The fallow leaf of editorial\ndrudgery was upon him, but I found\nhim utile to report success in his work.\nMr. Glass of the yews was not. In,\" I\nhad not the pleasure of ail interview\nwith him.\nA railroad \"worry oi iwo noura\nbrought me to thU city, and wending\nmy way to the Capitol I found the\nHouse had its (steam up and had run\nthe railroad question until it faiily\nf inoki-d under the strain. Mr. Cog\nhill, of Amheist, had offered, to the\nUii section of the Cumberland Gap\nJ;iint Resolution, an amendment em\npowering the A. M. & O. Co., upon\ntin; fiiilure of a connection of the Gap\nat the expiration of the time fixed in\nits charter, to expend the fund Bet\naside for the Va. & Ky. road, and any\nother means it may possess, in the\nbuilding of branch roads into Frank\nlin, to Clifton Forge, Richmond, down\nNow Itlvcr. from Saltville to the\nTazewell coal fields, to Scott and Le.\nand in extending its connections\nWestward, by lease or otherwise.\nAfter an animated struggle it was de\nfeated by a close vote. Judge Ould\nthen succeeded in engrafting upou it\na:i amendment, requiring the A. ST.\n&. O. Co. to depot-it its three and a half\nmillions, of bonds w ith a third party\ni) i. selected by said Company and\nthe 15ard of Public Works. It pass\ned by a majority of oiw, and no more.\nThofe of our friends who favored\nthe former and opposed the latter have\n!ne to believing thi't fcuch action on\ntheir part would test the purpose of\nKentucky and thereby promote the\nsuccess of the Va. & Ky. road, and at\nthet-ame lime place the question up\nMich positive and fixed ground that\n1'ie A. M. & O. Co., would not sutler\nby the repeated attempts which have\nby some been made upon its credit.\nCertainly it wems to me that the sr.\nHon of the opposite party places the\ncompany i.pon the rack of uncertain\nty and tends to Impair, if uot destroy,\ni: power to accomplish \"any good in\n.State. It is believed that if Ken\nt jcky will not meet us in two years she\nv. ill not do so at all and w e had as well\nnotify her nt once that limitation will\nrun against her, under a perfectly de\nfined alternative declared by the Lcg-i.-t\nJiilure of Virginia at this time.\nIf the A. M, & O. Co., cannot go in\nto Kentucky.- It mvst, and should be\nallowed to go elsewhere. Our purpose\nshould now be shown to Kentucky\npnd from th position we should not\nrecede. ;\nLast evening the Senaro defeated by\none vote, the tax bill, but to day it re\ntraced its action and passed it in a\nt-hape which will cause a committee\nof CO nference to adjust the trilling dis\nagreement between the two houses.\nIt retains the heavy and ohjectiorable\ntax on merchants, which many per\nsons, allege will destroy the whole\nsale trade of our Virginia cities. This\ntax bill 5s sharper than a musquito's\nbill nnd will draw blood for the al\nready bloated bondholder. For al\nthough A sold to B negroes and re\nceived pay in Slate bond and It lost\nthe negroes A demands the last dollar\nof the bond. Ye. I may have been a\nwidow, and the tax bill find the\nwidow if she has anything on which\nto be taxed.\nThe Stamp tax bill was to-day\nslumped to death in the House, its con-:\neiderution being positioned until next\nThursday, the last, day of the Session.\nKvery bill which does uot provoke\nserious opposition is being rushed\nthrough -under whip. On important\nmeasures our Southwestern Senators\nhave been generally agreed, but the\ndelegates therefrom have frequently\nbeen at variance. The two from our\nown county are ottpn antipodal in ,\ntheir views and actions.

Thousands of cattle and\nhogs have been drowned. And\ntheir name is legion, who, a few\ndays ago were in the possession ot\nwealth and happiness, are, to-day\npenniless, and in a forlorn and\nhopeless condition.\nLouisiana, that once prosperous\nand beautiful land of orange groves\nand flowers, and waving fields of\ncane, and of the nrghty king, cot\nton, is perhaps the greatest suffer\ner; five millions of her finest lands\nare, to-day, almost a waste, and\nher people are bowed down villi\nsoiroTv over this great calamity.\nIt w mid seem to the discerning\neye, that her cup of .sorrow and\nhumiliation was nearly filled, by\nradical rule and. internecine-strife,\nbut, surely, tluVcalamity has filled\nit to overflowing.

Not less than\nTWENTY SPLENDID SUGAR PLANTA\nTIONS\nhave been submerged from that\nsource already. That, however, was\nnothing compared with the sufferings\nof the people.

The\namount of\nCOTTON LAND -\nin these parishes in actual cultivation\nis ascertained to be 250,000 acres, be\nsides 10,000 acres in corn. These esti\nmates include only the large places,\nleaving out hundreds of small farmers,\nand all estimates for cattle, hog and\ngardens. The population of these nine\nparishes is 20.3S4 whites, and 54.033\nblacks, according to the census of 1870.\nIn the sugar producing parishes ascer\ntaiued facts discover an equal if not a\ngreater amount of ruiu and suffering.\nThese parishes are Point Coupee, East\nBaton Rouge, West Baton Rouge,\nIberville, Ascension, Assumption, La\nfource, St. James, St. John the Bap\nlist, St. Charles, Terreboue, and Pla\nquimiuies, The overflow in these pa\nrishes covers nearly 2,500,000 acres,\ntilled and 'unfilled, including a pro\nduction of\nTHIRTY THOUSAND HOGSHEADS OF\n, -;-' SUGAR,\na larfre production of rice, and some\nsmall farmers of whom there are many\nhundred, who lost their stock and\npretty much all else they possess,\nThe population of these paiisbes ac\ncording to the census of 1870, was 50,\n308 whites, and 72 241 blacks, making\na total of 122,609, from which must be\ndeducted .East Baton House, as a small\nportion of that parish sulfered from\nthe overflow, and that section being\nAve parishes, 10,309.

The passenger tram, No, 3,\ndue here at 4 :45 yesterday morning\nwas delayed on the opposite side of\nRaccoon mountain the delay being\ncaused by a slide that had dumped a\nlarge rock on the track.
